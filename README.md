# EEG-Functional-Connectome-Analysis-for-Propofol-Induced-Unconsciousness
This MATLAB project provides a complete pipeline for EEG-based functional connectivity and network analysis to study the neural mechanisms of propofol-induced unconsciousness.It includes preprocessing, source reconstruction, ROI extraction, functional connectivity estimation, network topology analysis, and machine learning–based classification between conscious and unconscious states.
