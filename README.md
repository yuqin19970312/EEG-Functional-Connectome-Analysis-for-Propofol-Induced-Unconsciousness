# Neurophysiological Connectomic Signatures of Consciousness during Propofol-Induced General Anesthesia
This MATLAB Scripts provides a complete pipeline for EEG-based functional connectivity and network analysis to study the neural mechanisms of propofol-induced unconsciousness.It includes preprocessing, source reconstruction, ROI extraction, functional connectivity estimation, network topology analysis, and machine learning–based classification between conscious and unconscious states.

## Overview
This repository contains a customized MATLAB code written along with the manuscript from Li et al. "Neurophysiological Connectomic Signatures of Consciousness during Propofol-Induced General Anesthesia". As this is adapted to a specific type of analysis, there are necessarily functions and parts of the codes that might not generalize so well to your data.
